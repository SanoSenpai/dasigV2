            Dasig is a Visayan word that means "to inspire, encourage, hold on."
            It is something that everyone of us needs right now. In these trying
            times, everyone is in constant battle, but with this simple
            advocacy, we want our organization to be of help in the simplest
            possible way.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a fervent commitment to this simple yet powerful advocacy, our
            organization seeks to extend a helping hand in the most fundamental
            manner possible. We aspire to be agents of change, catalysts for
            positivity, and providers of solace to those who find themselves
            struggling amidst the chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our endeavor to make a tangible difference, we call upon the
            generosity and compassion of our community. By joining hands and
            pooling our resources, we can reach out to those who remain unseen
            and unheard, offering them the support and assistance they so
            desperately need.
          </p>
          <p>
            We humbly appeal to your benevolence to aid us in our mission. Your
            contributions, no matter how modest, will serve as a lifeline for
            those who are yet to be reached. Every donation, every act of
            kindness, is a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity.
            Together, let us sow the seeds of Dasig, nurturing hope and
            resilience in the hearts of those who need it most.

                to those people who are in need. It secures financial aid that
                can be used by the people in need. Every donation goes a long
                way.
